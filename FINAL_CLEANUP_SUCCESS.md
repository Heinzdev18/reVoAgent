git rm DEEPSEEK_R1_INTEGRATION.md  
git rm FRONTEND_BACKEND_INTEGRATION_REPORT.md
git rm FRONTEND_STATUS.md
git rm INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md

# Commit the removal
git add .
git commit -m "📚 Complete documentation consolidation - remove original files

All documentation has been successfully moved to organized docs/ directory:
