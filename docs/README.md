## üìã Migration Status

This documentation directory is being organized from scattered files across the repository:

‚úÖ Documentation directory structure created  
‚è≥ Moving ARCHITECTURE.md from root  
‚è≥ Consolidating DASHBOARD_README.md content  
‚è≥ Merging FRONTEND_STATUS.md into FRONTEND_GUIDE.md  
‚è≥ Combining integration documentation  
‚è≥ Creating unified API documentation  

## ü§ù Contributing to Documentation
